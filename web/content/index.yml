    # What is lithe? #

    > moving in an easy and graceful way [^1]

    Simply put, a super fast and flexible framework for rapid static HTML site development. 

    It is not always necessary to conjure up a full fledged CMS system like Wordpress or Drupal just to get the message out. You end up with a lot of excessive stuff you most likely are not going to use.

    Personally I always find myself in a situation were I just need to quickly build a website or prototype something, and it is at that point were it would be nice that what I've build is easy to deploy to a web server.

    Lithe provides a way to create simple static websites that are easy to build, flexible and easy to deploy. 

    Although it all sounds basic lithe supports some awesome features.

    * HTML markup can be done using the powerfull [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org) templating engine. There is no need for any configuration this is supported out-of-the-box.
    * You can build [re-usable templates](/page/tutorial.html#re-usable-templates) and feed data via YAML files. This allows you to quickly add pages to your site which use the same templates. This is how this website is build. Checkout the source at [github](https://github.com/rikvanderkemp/lithe-site)
    * Your [data files](/page/tutorial.html#data-files) can use the widely acclaimed [Markdown](/page/tutorial.html#markdown) language NO html knowledge needed in your content.
